## Explanation

## Description
I am recreating the game of chess and applying the Singleton Design Pattern, Command Design Pattern, Factory Design Pattern, and Observer Design Pattern to the mechanics of chess

## Gererative AI Disclaimer
I used ChatGPT to quickly find the correct keyword and functions in my ```OnEndDrag()``` function in my BaseChessPiece class. I have only copied the usage of the keyword and functions, but have changed the functionality of the response to fit the way I have designed my game and how I envision the game to function.
